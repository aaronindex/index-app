# INDEX — EMERGENT SIGNALS LOG

Purpose:
Capture new feature ideas, UX friction, workflow insights, technical risks, and strategic opportunities as they arise during real usage and planning. This is a raw signal inbox, not a roadmap.

Branches hold thinking.
Instruments hold change.

Note:
[INDEX SIGNAL] entries are automatically generated across all INDEX branch chats and manually copied here as the canonical signal log. This file is reviewed weekly and is not a roadmap.

[INDEX SIGNAL] CATEGORY CREATION — PERSONAL BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE (PBI)
Index formally defines a new category: Personal Business Intelligence (PBI). This differentiates Index from PKM, AI companions, and productivity tools. Positions Index as “Business Intelligence for your mind.”

[INDEX SIGNAL] MOAT — LONGITUDINAL COGNITIVE DATASET
Index’s defensibility comes from persistent multi-year AI conversation data, structured memory, and evolving thought graphs. High switching costs and compounding value over time.

[INDEX SIGNAL] PRODUCT CORE — INTELLIGENCE OVER STORAGE
Index’s core utility emerges from BI-style outputs: patterns, themes, weekly intelligence digests, decisions, risks, signals, questions. Not traditional note-taking or task management.

[INDEX SIGNAL] ICP FOCUS — FOUNDERS, OPERATORS, CREATORS
Primary early adopters identified as founders, knowledge workers, analysts, and creators who generate high-volume thinking and require decision support. High willingness-to-pay and natural early traction.

[INDEX SIGNAL] PRICING POSITION — PREMIUM SAAS
Category creation + founder ICP supports premium pricing. Consumer: $20–$40/mo. Founder/operator: $49–$99/mo. Future team intelligence: $99–$249/mo.

[INDEX SIGNAL] GTM VECTOR — CATEGORY NARRATIVE
GTM strategy centered around teaching and owning the new category (PBI). Messaging pillar: “Your AI conversations are now a dataset.” Differentiation is narrative-first, not feature-first.

[INDEX SIGNAL] New Interaction Model:
A Status Layer emerges as a universal metadata attribute across Projects, Chats, Themes, and Threads.
This creates a new filtering and attention management paradigm in INDEX:
Suppress, foreground, and contextualize without deleting.

[INDEX SIGNAL]

DATE: (today’s date)

SOURCE CHAT: Strategic positioning / build ops

SIGNAL TYPE: Feature

RAW OBSERVATION: Index should auto-track progress of a project (and themes) based on observable actions — imports, highlights, branches, decisions — instead of manual checklists.

WHY IT MATTERS: Reduces maintenance overhead and gives users an honest picture of momentum and engagement without extra work.

MVP? No (post-MVP)

NOTES: Could show as a simple “Index health” or “Project momentum” meter per project.
