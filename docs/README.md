# INDEX v2 Docs

## Structure

- `00-foundation/` — Philosophy / stance (slow-changing)
- `01-ontology/` — Primitives + temporal model
- `02-editorial/` — Voice + surface behavior rules
- `03-inference_engine/` — Builder logic for arcs/phases/tension/pulses/state
- `04-architecture/` — Data pipeline + schema overlays
- `05-product_direction/` — System logic + operating model + build sequence

## Rule
When unsure where something goes:
- “What is this?” → ontology
- “How does it speak?” → editorial
- “How does it compute?” → inference
- “How does it map to Supabase/jobs?” → architecture
- “How do we proceed / explain?” → product_direction
