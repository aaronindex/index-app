# Snapshot & Pulse Model

## Structural Layers

Ledger
Persistent memory (decisions, results, arcs).

Pulse
Threshold crossing.
Clear editorial signal.

Field Note
Shared structural context for the moment.

Snapshot
Current editorial lens on reality.

---

## Threshold Logic

Below threshold:
Silent sensing.

Cross threshold:
Clear pulse.

No anticipatory signals.

---

## Snapshot Behavior

Snapshots are:
- State-based
- Editorial
- Recency-weighted

Snapshots are NOT:
- Live feeds
- Continuous AI rewrites
- Historical entries

Snapshots update only when underlying structure changes.

## Reactivation

Older arcs do not resurface via navigation.

Structure pulls them forward when:
- New thinking reconnects arcs
- Structural gravity shifts
