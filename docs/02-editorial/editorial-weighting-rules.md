# Editorial Weighting — Builder Logic

## Principle
Weight is expressed through presentation, not interpretation.

---

## Pulse Ordering

Ordering reflects:
- recency
- structural density

Ordering does NOT imply importance.

All pulses maintain equal editorial tone.

---

## Field Notes

Single shared field note per structural moment.

Field notes:
- short and dense by default
- expand only when complexity increases

Tone:
Thoughtful field note.
Dry without sterility.

---

## Snapshot Behavior

Snapshots are state-based editorial lenses.

Snapshots update when:
- threshold events occur
- arc configuration shifts
- structural gravity changes

Snapshots evolve quietly.
Language may reorganize to match reality.

---

## Compression

Recency drives compression.

Older structure becomes less prominent but remains intact.
