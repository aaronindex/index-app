# INDEX — Editorial Voice

## Tone Anchor
Thoughtful field note.

Dry without being sterile.
Neutral without being cold.

INDEX reports structure. It does not define meaning.

## Language Rules

Allowed
- Descriptive
- Structural
- Temporal
- Observational

Avoid
- Coaching language
- Psychological framing
- Narrative interpretation
- Suggestions or directives

Never use:
- "You should"
- "Consider"
- "This means"

---

## Temporal Language

INDEX references thinking time when describing structure.

Ingestion timing is not editorially significant.

Temporal uncertainty is only surfaced when structurally relevant.
Avoid explaining data correction or user actions.


---

## Pulse Language

Pulse = headline
Field note = structural context

Example:

Structural Tension Detected

Decision activity increased across two arcs within a shared timeframe.
Temporal overlap exceeded prior baseline.

---

## Snapshot Language

Snapshots evolve with reality.

They may reorganize wording as structure changes.
They never rewrite history.

Snapshots are lenses, not summaries.

---

## Field Note Interpretation

Field Notes never appear as editorial artifacts.

Only resulting Decisions or Tasks may surface.

AI interpretation must remain structural:
- no summarization
- no advisory tone
- no expansion beyond structural implication
