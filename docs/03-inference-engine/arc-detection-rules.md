# Arc Detection — Builder Logic

## Purpose
Arcs represent emergent temporal structure across projects.
Arcs are inferred, never manually created.

---

## Signals That Contribute to Arc Formation

- Decisions occurring within shared thematic context
- Structural overlap across multiple projects
- Recurring phases or language patterns
- Temporal clustering of activity
- Result feedback loops reinforcing trajectory

No single signal creates an arc.

---

## Arc Activation

An arc becomes active when:

1. Multiple structural signals align
2. Temporal density exceeds baseline
3. Cross-project linkage becomes statistically meaningful

Activation is silent.
No user-facing label creation is required.

---

## Arc Compression

Arcs reduce visibility when:

- Structural activity decreases
- Decision/result density drops
- Temporal distance increases

Compression affects presence only.
Historical structure remains intact.

---

## Arc Reactivation

Arcs re-emerge when:

- New thinking reconnects prior structure
- Imported chats reinforce previous decision lineage
- Cross-project signals realign

Reactivation appears naturally in snapshots.
No explicit "reactivation" messaging.
