# Tension Threshold Logic

## Definition
Tension = structural friction between arcs or phases.

Tension is never predictive.

---

## Preconditions

Tension may form when:

- Two arcs exhibit conflicting momentum
- Decision cadence diverges across related arcs
- Result feedback contradicts active trajectory
- Resource signals imply competing structural gravity

---

## Threshold Rule

Below threshold:
Silent sensing.

At threshold:
Clear pulse emitted.

No anticipatory language allowed.

---

## Pulse Behavior

Pulse characteristics:
- Editorial headline
- Equal weight across pulses
- Ordered by structural recency

No ranking language.
No urgency framing.

---

## Resolution

Tension resolves when:

- Structural alignment increases
- Arc momentum stabilizes
- Result feedback converges

Resolution is quiet.
No celebratory messaging.
