# System Invariants

INDEX is governed by structural constraints
that do not change across versions.

---

## Deep Invariant

INDEX records structural change,
not cognitive activity.

Conversations, reflections, and context may enter the system,
but only committed structural outcomes persist across time.

---

## Structural Recording

INDEX records decisions.
It does not record discussion.

Discussion may lead to imports or Field Notes,
but only structural outcomes persist.

---

## Temporal Physics

INDEX operates on event time,
not interaction time.

Thinking time drives structure.

---

## Temporal Expression

INDEX expresses motion through spacing of structural change,
not through analysis of cognitive content.

---

## Persistence Rule

Only persistent artifacts may influence state_hash.

Ephemeral inputs introduce no structural change
until saved as Tasks or Decisions.

---

## Intentional Ingestion

If no Task or Decision is saved,
no structural event occurred.

---

## Drift Warning

INDEX does not evolve by recording more thinking.

Features that preserve cognitive activity without structural commitment
risk weakening temporal inference and arc clarity.

Common drift patterns include:

- storing insights without decisions
- introducing AI guidance or coaching
- ambient ingestion without intentional promotion

When evaluating new features, ask:

Does this record structural change,
or does it record cognitive activity?
