# INDEX — Core Principles

## Purpose
INDEX is a structural ledger that stabilizes thinking after it happens.
Thinking, discussion, and work exist outside the system.

INDEX reflects structure. Humans decide meaning.

## What INDEX Is
- A temporal structural mirror
- A quiet editorial briefing
- A ledger for decisions, arcs, and results
- A nervous system for personal cognition

## What INDEX Is Not
- Not a thinking surface
- Not coaching or advisory
- Not a task manager
- Not a visual knowledge graph
- Not a workspace

---

## Structural Model

Projects
- Flat containers for ingestion
- Never grouped
- No hierarchy

Arcs / Phases
- Emergent temporal structures
- Span projects
- Define relationship through time

Decisions & Results
- Carry structural weight
- Inform arc evolution

Tension
- Appears only after threshold crossing

## Design Philosophy

Relationship emerges through time and meaning.

Structure describes. Humans decide.

Silence is meaningful.

Recency shapes presence — not importance.
