# INDEX — Foundation

## Core Premise
INDEX is a structural ledger that stabilizes thinking after it happens.

Thinking, discussion, and task execution occur outside the system
(GPT, Slack, meetings, docs, etc.).

INDEX reflects structure.
It does not host cognition.

## Structural Philosophy

Relationship emerges through time and meaning.

Structure describes.
Humans decide.

INDEX never:
- coaches
- interprets intent
- suggests action
- predicts outcomes

Silence is meaningful.

## Single-Player Identity

INDEX is a personal nervous system.

It is:
- calm
- editorial
- temporal

It is not:
- a workspace
- a productivity tool
- a visual map

Projects exist as ingestion anchors only.

---

## Ontology Direction

Flat spatial structure.
Deep temporal structure.

No hierarchy.
No sub-projects.
No manual grouping.

Arcs and phases create relationship across projects.

## World-AI Trajectory

Today:
Human structural awareness.

Later:
World-AI learns from collective structural memory.

INDEX is a substrate, not an AI brain.
