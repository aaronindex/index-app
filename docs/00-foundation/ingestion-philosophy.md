# Ingestion Philosophy

INDEX receives thinking.
It does not generate thinking.

INDEX is not a storage system.
It is not a knowledge archive.
It is not a journaling surface.

INDEX exists to receive moments that change structure.

---

## What Belongs in INDEX

Capture moments that change how you operate or what you are building.

Examples:

- decisions
- commitments
- constraints
- realizations
- tensions
- directional shifts

If nothing changes structurally,
it does not belong in INDEX.

Interesting information is not enough.
Reference material is not enough.
Preferences without consequence are not enough.

INDEX receives structural weight, not information.

---

## Capture

Capture is the only ingestion gesture.

Users may capture:

- shared AI thinking
- discussions
- reflections
- external stimulus
- short excerpts
- full threads

Capture precedes organization.
Inference does not require clean transcripts.
Inference does not require perfect formatting.

Reduction precedes normalization.

---

## Containers

All structure lives inside containers.

Container types:

- Self (system-level identity container)
- Projects (flat, user-created)

UI may refer to Self as “Me.”

Nothing exists outside containers.
No structural objects float above them.

Capture must be placed into a container before structural persistence.

---

## Source Behavior

Every capture has a source.

Source may be handled in one of two ways:

### Durable (Default)

The source remains internally as part of structural history.

Durable sources:

- may accumulate structural weight
- may influence Direction
- may contribute to Shifts
- may connect across containers

Durable capture becomes part of the ongoing structural record.

---

### Reduce & Discard Source

The source is used as stimulus only.

It is interpreted once,
structural outputs are generated,
and the source is discarded.

Only structural outcomes persist.

Discarded sources:

- do not accumulate pattern weight
- do not form ongoing structural gravity
- do not contribute durable context

If no structural outcome (Decision or Task) is saved,
no structural event occurred.

---

## Temporal Integrity

INDEX distinguishes between:

- thinking time (when the thinking occurred)
- ingestion time (when the artifact entered INDEX)

Structural inference operates on thinking time.

Temporal precision is not required.
Temporal shape matters more than timestamp accuracy.

If a source is durable,
its thinking time contributes to structural pattern formation.

If a source is reduced & discarded,
its thinking time applies only to resulting structural outputs.

Ingestion time is bookkeeping only.

INDEX models event time, not observation time.

---

## Direction and Shifts

INDEX presents structure as a calm mirror.

Externally visible structural state includes:

- Direction (ongoing structural themes)
- Shifts (meaningful structural change events)

Arcs, phases, pulse logic, and other inference mechanisms remain internal.

INDEX does not expose editorial artifacts.
INDEX exposes structural state.

---

## Ingestion Principle

INDEX does not ingest ambient data in personal mode.

Capture must be deliberate.

Only structural change persists.
Source content never crosses the external boundary.

INDEX is a structural ledger.
Structure informs action.
INDEX does not perform action.
