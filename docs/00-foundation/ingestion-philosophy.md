# Ingestion Philosophy

INDEX receives thinking.
It does not generate thinking.

Users import:
- chats
- discussions
- structured reflections

Only thinking with perceived weight tends to be imported.
Weight is self-selected by behavior.

INDEX does not ingest ambient data in personal mode.

Org platform uses agentic ingestion.

## Temporal Windows

Imported thinking carries a temporal window.

INDEX distinguishes between:

- thinking time (when the thinking occurred)
- ingestion time (when the artifact entered INDEX)

Inference operates on thinking time.

Thinking time may be:

- derived from source timestamps
- loosely set by the user (today / this week / last month)
- estimated when unclear

Temporal windows allow structure to emerge from real timelines,
not ingestion bursts.

## Ephemeral Field Notes

INDEX may receive short reflections called Field Notes.

Field Notes are transient ingestion events.
They are not stored artifacts.

A Field Note exists only to allow structural interpretation
within a project context.

Field Notes may produce:
- Decisions
- Tasks

The Field Note itself is discarded after interpretation.

Field Notes inherit project temporal context
and do not introduce new thinking-time signals.

External content is never stored.
Only structural change persists.

Field Note Principle:

If no Task or Decision is saved,
no structural event occurred.
