# Ingestion Philosophy

INDEX receives thinking.
It does not generate thinking.

Users import:
- chats
- discussions
- structured reflections

Only thinking with perceived weight tends to be imported.
Weight is self-selected by behavior.

INDEX does not ingest ambient data in personal mode.

Org platform uses agentic ingestion.

## Primary Ingestion Mode — Micro Capture

INDEX supports two ingestion modes:

1. Micro Capture (primary)
2. Thread Import (secondary)

Micro Capture represents a deliberate elevation gesture.

A user may capture:
- a paragraph
- a decision moment
- a constraint
- a realization
- a short exchange

Micro Capture is the default ingestion path.

It does not require:
- role cleanup
- full transcript structure
- precise temporal assignment
- pre-assigned project certainty

Capture precedes organization.

Inference operates on minimal content.
Organization may occur after structural candidates are detected.

---

## Thread Import (Intentional Deep Capture)

Thread Import exists for full arc preservation.

It is:
- heavier
- less frequent
- intentionally chosen

Thread Import signals:
“This entire thread of thinking carries structural weight.”

Micro Capture demotes routine full imports,
while promoting intentional deep capture.

---

## Temporal Windows

Imported thinking carries a temporal window.

INDEX distinguishes between:

- thinking time (when the thinking occurred)
- ingestion time (when the artifact entered INDEX)

Inference operates on thinking time.

Thinking time may be:

- derived from source timestamps
- loosely set by the user (today / this week / last month)
- estimated when unclear

Temporal windows allow structure to emerge from real timelines,
not ingestion bursts.

---

## Ephemeral Field Notes

INDEX may receive short reflections called Field Notes.

Field Notes are transient ingestion events.
They are not stored artifacts.

A Field Note exists only to allow structural interpretation
within a project context.

Field Notes may produce:
- Decisions
- Tasks

The Field Note itself is discarded after interpretation.

Field Notes inherit project temporal context
and do not introduce new thinking-time signals.

External content is never stored.
Only structural change persists.

Field Note Principle:

If no Task or Decision is saved,
no structural event occurred.

---

## Ingestion Principle

INDEX does not require clean transcripts to begin structural inference.

Structure may emerge from:
- partial context
- ambiguous roles
- minimal temporal precision

Reduction precedes normalization.

Only structural outcomes persist.
