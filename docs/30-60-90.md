# INDEX — 30 / 60 / 90 Day Growth Plan

**Purpose**  
Reach 300–500 high-signal users *without paid spend*, with proof of retention and early willingness to pay.

This is an operating document, not a strategy memo. It defines what to do, when to do it, and when to stop.

---

## Core Assumptions (Non-Negotiable)

- INDEX grows through **trust, not reach**
- Early users are **thinking partners**, not customers
- Retention > acquisition
- Manual before scalable
- No paid ads before signal

If these assumptions break, pause execution.

---

# DAYS 1–30 — FOUNDATION & PROOF (0 → ~50 users)

**Objective:** Prove INDEX reduces cognitive load for a specific persona and lock the narrative.

---

## WEEK 1 — Frame + Instrument

### Objectives
- Define what success looks like
- Ensure the product can demonstrate value without explanation

### Required Outputs
- Clear definition of:
  - **First Aha Moment** (e.g. surfacing a real Decision from prior AI chaos)
  - **Retention Intent Signal** (explicit desire to use again)
- Analytics confirmed for:
  - Signup → first import
  - First Highlight / Decision surfaced
  - Day-7 return
- **INDEX Builds INDEX demo project**
  - Curated AI chats
  - Clean titles
  - Visible arc: chaos → structure → decisions → shipping
- Internal doc: *Why INDEX exists*

### Success Gate
- You can explain INDEX in **30 seconds** without features
- Demo clearly shows thinking → outcome

Do not proceed if this gate is missed.

---

## WEEK 2 — Trusted Circle Validation (10–20 users)

### Objectives
- Validate real value with high-signal users
- Listen for retention intent, not compliments

### Required Actions
- Identify 10–20 high-signal people
- Personal outreach only
- Each user:
  - Reviews demo project
  - Imports **one real thing**
- Capture structured feedback using the same questions for all users

### Feedback Questions
- Where did this reduce effort?
- Where was it confusing or heavy?
- Would you use this again next week?
- What would you be disappointed to lose?

### Success Gate
- ≥5 users express clear **retention intent**
- ≥3 users describe the *same benefit* in their own words

If not met, iterate product or positioning.

---

## WEEK 3 — Sharpen + Soft Publicity

### Objectives
- Remove friction
- Test whether strangers can self-select

### Required Actions
- Remove at least **one** non-essential product element
- Tighten onboarding around single use case:
  > “INDEX built itself — here’s how”
- Publish:
  - 1 long-form piece (LinkedIn or blog)
  - 2 short POV posts
- Allow soft public signups (no announcement blast)

### Success Gate
- ≥5 signups from people you do not know
- ≥1 inbound message expressing interest or curiosity

---

## WEEK 4 — Repeatability Test

### Objectives
- Determine if enrollment can be repeated

### Required Actions
- Repeat outreach with refined framing
- Observe onboarding friction
- Decide the **single story** to repeat for the next 60 days

### Success Gate
- 30–50 total users
- Clear articulation of:
  - Who INDEX is for
  - What problem it solves
  - Why alternatives fail

---

# DAYS 31–60 — MANUAL GROWTH ENGINE (50 → ~300 users)

**Objective:** Prove users can be enrolled predictably, not accidentally.

---

## Weekly Operating Loop (Weeks 5–8)

Every week, without exception:

### Public
- Publish **1 real artifact**:
  - Decision surfaced
  - Before/after thinking
  - Lesson learned

### Direct
- Send 20–30 personal outreaches
- Target builders, consultants, AI-heavy operators

### Group
- One small-group surface:
  - Founder Slack
  - Private walkthrough
  - Live demo

### Product
- Fix the **single biggest friction point** discovered that week

### Weekly Success Gate
- 10–20 new users
- 3–5 meaningful conversations
- At least one message indicating real cognitive relief

---

## Day-60 Hard Gate

You must be able to say:

> “I know how to find users, what they value, and why they come back — even if it’s manual.”

If not met:
- Pause acquisition
- Revisit product and narrative
- Do not add channels

---

# DAYS 61–90 — COMPOUNDING WITHOUT SPEND (300 → ~500 users)

**Objective:** Turn repetition into momentum and prepare for monetization signal.

---

## Additions to Weekly Loop

- Publish **3–5 foundational pieces** total:
  - Why AI thinking breaks down
  - Why chat ≠ memory
  - Why blank tools fail
  - How INDEX is different
- Polish demo project so users understand value without guidance
- Tag users by:
  - Use case
  - Depth of engagement

---

## First Paid Conversion Moment

### Principle
No hard paywall. No pricing gymnastics. Test willingness to pay for continuity.

### Structure
- Free tier:
  - Limited active projects
  - Limited surfaced outputs
- Paid unlock:
  - Ongoing memory for real projects
  - Framed as *continuity*, not features

### What This Tests
- Will users pay to avoid losing continuity?
- Does payment correlate with retention?

### Success Gate
- ≥2–5% of active users attempt to upgrade
- Clear language emerges for *why* users pay

If zero attempts occur, the issue is value clarity — not pricing.

## When to Revisit Seed Capital + Ads

Only after:
- ≥300 users
- Clear retention curve
- First paid conversions
- One repeatable enrollment motion

Until then:
- Time > money
- Taste > tactics
