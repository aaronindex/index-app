# DEPRECATED IDEAS — INDEX

## Purpose
Preserve removed feature thinking and rationale without polluting alpha UX or roadmap.

## Deprecated Feature Concepts

### Theme Map ("The Field") visualization
- Density-based theme cards
- Connection lines
- Theme detail views
- Mini visual map for cognitive overview
- Removed: Too heavy for activation ROI vs complexity.

### Thread Explorer / Mini-Map
- Linear branch visualization of conversations
- Mini cognitive map before deep dive
- Removed: Branching model replaced by Thought Objects.

### Global Action List
- System-wide task aggregation across all domains
- Sort by project, recency, status
- Removed: High UX surface, low marginal activation value.

### Theme Builder (tool)
- Select chats/highlights → auto-generate a new theme
- Include description, connections, suggested status
- Removed: Themes are now manual personal-domain buckets.

### Quantitative Gravity Metrics
- Numeric project weight scoring
- Density visualization
- Removed: Violates lightweight/no-numbers alpha principle.

### Cross-Domain Semantic Linking
- Personal ↔ Business vector crossover
- Removed: Domains intentionally siloed.

### In-INDEX Micro-Chat UI
- One-shot inline chat box
- No thread persistence
- Removed: INDEX is not a place to chat.

## Rationale principles preserved
- INDEX should reduce cognitive load and restart friction
- Intelligence should surface meaning objects, not chats
- Product should feel like a leverage layer, not a chatbot
- Temporal planning and qualitative nudges outperform visual mapping in alpha
- User owns all data, mutations, and exports
