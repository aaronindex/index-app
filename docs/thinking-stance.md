## INDEX — How We Think

This document defines the **thinking stance** of INDEX.

It governs how INDEX reasons, what it surfaces, what it suppresses,  
and how we decide what belongs — or does not.

This is not a feature list.  
This is the operating discipline behind the product.

It should change rarely.

---

## Core Stance (Non-Negotiable)

INDEX exists to help people **think cleaner, not more**.

INDEX is not where thinking happens —
it’s where thinking is made usable.

We favor:
- clarity over cleverness  
- containment over expansion  
- decisions and commitments over speculation  
- reduction over accumulation  
- orientation over exploration  

INDEX exists to **reduce cognitive entropy**, not create more of it.

---

## What INDEX Actively Avoids (Anti-Goals)

INDEX is explicitly designed to resist:

- Recursive ideation loops (“AI mush”)
- Branching for its own sake
- Chat-first or conversation-centric workflows
- Infinite follow-ups disguised as insight
- Activity that feels productive but resolves nothing

If a feature increases thinking volume without increasing clarity,  
it is suspect by default.

---

## Conversations vs Thought Objects

INDEX distinguishes sharply between **input** and **meaning**.

- Conversations are raw input.
- Thought Objects are distilled meaning.

The only atomic units of meaning in INDEX are:
- **Highlights** (what matters)
- **Tasks** (what must be done)
- **Decisions** (what must be chosen)

INDEX does not preserve conversations to continue them.  
It preserves conversations to **extract meaning from them**.

This is why:
- Branching is removed
- Start Chat is constrained
- Ask Index is reductive, not exploratory

---

## Structure Is Opinionated

Structure exists to *reduce load*, not to model reality perfectly.

- **Projects** are the sole containers for business work.
- **Themes** are the sole containers for personal reflection.
- There is no crossover of signal between domains.
- We do not multiply containers to create the illusion of progress.

If a structure exists, it must earn its keep.

---

## Action Is Qualitative, Not Managerial

INDEX is not a task manager.

- Tasks and Decisions represent **commitment**, not scheduling.
- Planning is qualitative, not calendar-driven.
- “Minimum next action” matters more than total progress.
- Numeric precision is avoided in favor of judgment.

INDEX helps users **orient toward action**.  
It does not manage execution for them.

---

## Start Chat Is an Escape Hatch

Start Chat exists to support **deliberate resolution**, not exploration.

- It is rare.
- It is bounded.
- It is intentional.
- It always exports context; it never imports conversation.

Start Chat is allowed only from:
- Tasks
- Decisions
- Project-level deliberate thinking

It must never become a substitute for structuring thought inside INDEX.

If Start Chat increases chaos, it is misused.

---

## AI Is a Constraint, Not a Driver

AI in INDEX is a **supporting intelligence**, not the protagonist.

- AI may suggest; the user decides.
- AI must reduce, not expand.
- AI should surface uncertainty explicitly, not resolve it by ideation.
- Follow-ups must force a move (clarify, decide, commit, deprioritize).

We distrust features that originate from AI suggestion alone  
unless grounded in lived user pain.

---

## Surfacing & Suppression Are Features

Visibility in INDEX is opinionated by design.

INDEX prioritizes:
- unresolved over recent  
- linked over isolated  
- active over inactive  
- priority over completeness  

INDEX suppresses aggressively in order to preserve clarity.

If something disappears, it is because it no longer deserves attention.

---

## The Role INDEX Plays

INDEX is not:
- a facilitator
- a therapist
- a brainstorm partner
- a social surface

INDEX behaves like a calm, firm operator:
- It keeps thinking from drifting.
- It refuses to escalate prematurely.
- It surfaces what still matters.
- It says “this is unresolved” without drama.

---

## Guardrail for Future Features

Every new feature must pass this test:

- Does it reduce cognitive load?
- Does it collapse or expand thinking?
- Does it introduce a new surface for recursion?
- Can the same outcome be achieved with fewer affordances?

If the answer is unclear, the feature does not belong.

---

## Final Test

Before building, keeping, or shipping anything, ask:

> Does this help the user think cleaner —  
> or does it merely create activity?

If it merely creates activity, it does not belong in INDEX.

## How This Document Is Used

This document is not aspirational.  
It is operational.

### 1. As a Design Gate
Before building or keeping any feature, this document is consulted first.

If a feature:
- expands thinking without increasing clarity
- introduces recursion or branching
- creates a new surface for idle exploration

it is rejected or redesigned until it conforms.

### 2. As an AI Constraint Layer
All AI behavior in INDEX must conform to this stance.

This includes:
- Ask Index synthesis
- Follow-up generation
- Weekly Digest narration
- Start Chat context packs

AI is constrained to:
- reduce
- label uncertainty
- force decisions or commitments
- avoid speculative expansion

If AI behavior drifts, the fix happens here first — not in UI.

### 3. As a UX Filter
UI affordances are evaluated against this stance.

If an affordance:
- invites reaction over judgment
- encourages “just one more thought”
- creates optionality without responsibility

it is removed or made intentionally inconvenient.

### 4. As a Product Decision Tiebreaker
When tradeoffs arise, this stance wins.

INDEX chooses:
- fewer features over flexibility
- strong defaults over configurability
- suppression over completeness

Even when this frustrates some users.

### 5. As a Long-Term Constraint
This document is allowed to change rarely.

If it changes:
- the product must change with it
- existing features may need removal
- complexity is paid down immediately

This is intentional.
