## INDEX — How We Think

This document captures the *stance* that governs INDEX.
It defines how we evaluate ideas, when we say no, and what “good” feels like.
It is not exhaustive and should change rarely.

---

## Core Orientation

- We optimize for **clarity over cleverness**.
- We prefer **containment over expansion**.
- We value **orientation over exploration**.
- We bias toward **subtraction, not addition**.
- We treat focus as a finite resource.

INDEX exists to *reduce cognitive entropy*, not create more of it.

---

## On AI

- AI is a **supporting intelligence**, not the driver.
- AI may suggest, but the user decides.
- We distrust features that originate from AI suggestion alone unless grounded in lived pain.
- We avoid chat-first UX patterns.
- We avoid recursive ideation loops (“AI mush”).

If a feature increases ideation without increasing clarity, it is suspect.

---

## On Structure

- Projects (Business) and Themes (Personal) are the only containers.
- Highlights, Tasks, and Decisions are the atomic units of meaning.
- Branching is a UI artifact, not a cognitive primitive.
- We do not multiply threads to feel productive.

If a structure exists, it must earn its keep.

---

## On Action

- Tasks and Decisions represent commitment.
- Planning is qualitative, not calendar-driven.
- “Next action” matters more than “total progress.”
- We avoid task-manager bloat.

INDEX helps users orient toward action — it does not manage execution.

---

## On Start Chat

- Start Chat is an escape hatch, not a default.
- It is rare, bounded, and intentional.
- It exists to resolve uncertainty, not to continue thinking endlessly.
- It must never become a substitute for structuring thought.

If Start Chat increases chaos, it is misused.

---

## On UX

- Calm beats busy.
- Fewer options beat flexible systems.
- Defaults should be strong.
- Surfaces should invite judgment, not reaction.

INDEX should feel like a *thinking environment*, not a dashboard.

---

## On Trust

- Private by default.
- No performative sharing.
- No social pressure.
- No dark patterns.

Users must feel safe putting their real thinking here.

## Final Test

Before building or keeping a feature, ask:

> Does this reduce confusion, or does it merely create activity?

If it does not reduce confusion, it does not belong.
