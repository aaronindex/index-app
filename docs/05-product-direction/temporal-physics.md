# Temporal Physics of INDEX

## Presence vs Memory

Ledger = memory.
Snapshot = present reality.

Older structure compresses naturally through recency.

Nothing is deleted.
Nothing is rewritten.

---

## Resurfacing

Structure reactivates history.

Users do not manually resurface projects.
New structural relevance pulls them forward.

---

## Evolution

Snapshots quietly evolve in language
as reality evolves.

Acknowledgment occurs only when
structural state meaningfully shifts.
