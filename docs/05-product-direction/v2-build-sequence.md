# INDEX v2 — Build Sequence

## Placement Strategy

Structural signals appear in three layers:

1. Project-Level Structure
Location: "read" or project overview surface

2. Global Structure (Meta-Arcs)
Location: Logged-in Homepage

3. Temporal Reflection
Location: Weekly Digest

No new top-level tabs introduced.

---

## Phase 1 — Invisible Structural Engine

Goal:
Introduce arcs, phases, and tension detection without UI change.

Build:

- Arc inference pipeline
- Decision/result structural scoring
- Cross-project linkage detection
- Temporal density tracking
- Threshold engine

Output:
Internal structural state only.

---

## Phase 2 — Project-Level Structure (Read Tab Evolution)

Add to project overview:

- active arc indicators (editorial language only)
- local field notes
- project-specific pulses

Rules:

- never visual graphing
- never manual arc management
- tone remains editorial

Project surface answers:
"What structural reality exists inside this project?"

---

## Phase 3 — Global Snapshot (Logged-In Homepage)

Homepage becomes:

Current Structural Briefing.

Surface:

- meta-arcs spanning projects
- active tensions
- shared field note
- evolving snapshot

Rules:

- equal pulse weight
- editorial ordering by recency

Homepage answers:
"What is the current shape of my thinking?"

---

## Phase 4 — Weekly Digest Evolution

Digest becomes condensed structural mirror.

Include:

- snapshot compression
- pulse highlights
- arc movement

Digest is not a summary.
Digest is a temporal checkpoint.

---

## Phase 5 — Compression & Reactivation

Add:

- recency-based compression logic
- silent arc reactivation
- snapshot evolution rules

No resurfacing UI.
Structure pulls forward automatically.

---

## Guardrails

Never add:

- thinking prompts
- coaching language
- visual mapping
- project hierarchy

Structure emerges above projects.
