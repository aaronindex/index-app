# INDEX — Operating Model (Evolution Strategy)

## Core Position

INDEX v2 is a direct evolution of the current system.

INDEX operates as a structural ledger grounded in event time
rather than interaction time.

Structure reflects when thinking occurred,
not when users interacted with the interface.

Existing infrastructure remains:
- authentication
- payments
- ingestion flows
- tab navigation
- Ask Index
- weekly digest

v2 introduces a structural nervous system layer
without disrupting current user workflows.

---

## Layering Strategy

Existing System = Interaction Layer
INDEX v2 = Structural Layer above interaction.

Users continue:
- importing chats
- using Ask Index
- navigating projects

New logic interprets structure silently in background.

---

## What Changes

1. Editorial Surface
Replace summary-like outputs with:
- pulses
- shared field notes
- evolving snapshots

2. Temporal Awareness
Introduce arcs/phases inference.
No UI for manual arc creation.

3. Threshold Engine
Detect structural tension and emit pulses.

4. Ephemeral Field Notes

Users may capture short Field Notes inside projects.

Field Notes allow external stimulus to be structurally reduced
without storing source material.

Only resulting Decisions or Tasks persist.

Field Notes do not introduce new workspace features.

---

## What Does NOT Change

- Projects remain flat
- Tabs remain intact
- Ask Index continues as thinking lens
- Weekly digest remains temporal touchpoint
- Billing & auth untouched

No new workspace features.
No task management layer.

## MVP v2 Scope

### Phase 1 — Invisible Infrastructure
- arc inference logic
- structural density scoring
- threshold detection rules
- snapshot generation engine

No UI changes yet.

---

### Phase 2 — Editorial Surface
- introduce pulse rendering
- introduce shared field note
- evolve snapshot language

Minimal UI adjustments only.

---

### Phase 3 — Nervous System Stability
- recency-based compression
- arc reactivation behavior
- snapshot evolution rules

---

## Design Guardrails

Never introduce:
- coaching prompts
- predictive signals
- visual graphs
- hierarchy controls

Editorial weight replaces visual signaling.

---

## Org Platform Relationship

INDEX v2 remains single-player.

Org platform is a separate product sharing ontology.

INDEX v2 acts as:
- proving ground
- ontology stabilizer
- editorial reference layer
