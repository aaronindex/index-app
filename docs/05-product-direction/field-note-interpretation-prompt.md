# Ephemeral Source Interpretation Prompt

This prompt must never introduce new ontology primitives.
It operates strictly within existing structural outputs.

## Purpose

Define AI behavior when a capture is marked:

Reduce & Discard Source.

Ephemeral sources are:

- interpreted within container context
- not retained as durable artifacts
- used only to generate structural outcomes

---

## Constraints

- Do not summarize external content.
- Do not generate new ideas.
- Do not provide advice.
- Remain structural and neutral.
- Maximum:
  - 2 Decisions
  - 2 Tasks
