# INDEX — Onboarding (v2)

## Philosophy

Do not fabricate structure.
Do not fake Direction.
Do not over-explain.

Introduce the system calmly.

On first login:
- Spotlight tour auto-opens.
- Fully skippable.
- Restartable via UI control.

---

## Spotlight Tour (3 Slides)

### Slide 1 — Projects

Highlight: Projects area.

Message directionally:

Anything you save lives inside a project.

Projects are simple containers.
Structure emerges across them.

No hierarchy.
No complexity.

---

### Slide 2 — Direction

Highlight: Direction area.

Message directionally:

As decisions accumulate, Direction becomes visible.

Direction isn’t written.
It forms over time.

Shifts mark meaningful change.

---

### Slide 3 — Extension

Highlight: Extension entry point.

Message:

Capture moments while you think.  
Install the extension to save in real time.

No urgency.
No pressure.
No growth framing.

---

### Slide 4 — Import First Chat

Highlight: Import button.

Message:

Import a conversation to get started.

After first import:
- Existing Reduce modal appears.
- Optional subtle follow-up nudge after first Reduce.

---

## Extension Nudging System

Extension is acceleration layer.

We nudge without pressure.

---

### Persistent Extension Banner

Location:
Top of homepage (calm, INDEX style).

Message:

Capture moments while you think.  
Install the extension.

Behavior:
- Dismissible.
- No countdown.
- No urgency.
- No marketing tone.

---

### Bottom-Left Pill

Small, subtle pill:

Install extension

Conditions:
- Visible until first Quick Capture detected.
- OR until user completes X full imports (threshold TBD).
- Dismissible.

If dismissed:
- Remains hidden unless re-enabled.

If first Quick Capture occurs:
- Permanently removed.

---

## Ingestion Hierarchy

Primary long-term behavior:
1. Quick Capture (extension)

Secondary:
2. Manual full-chat paste (onboarding + low frequency)

Unassigned:
- Temporary staging shelf.
- Inert until placed.
- Must be assigned before participating in structure.

---

## Density Model

Low capture frequency:
- Still valuable.
- Direction forms slowly.

High capture frequency:
- Faster clarity.
- Earlier shifts.
- Higher structural resolution.

Value does not depend on volume.
Volume improves resolution.

---

## Structural Authority

Users edit:
- Decisions
- Placement
- Containers

Users do not edit:
- Direction
- Shifts

Direction is emergent.
Shifts are threshold-based.

No versioning.
No narrative editing.
No planning overlays.

---

## Outcome

INDEX should feel:

Calm.
Structural.
Stable.
Grounded.

The product promise remains:

Thinking that accumulates.
