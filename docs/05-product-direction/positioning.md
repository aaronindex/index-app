# INDEX — Positioning (v2)

## Primary Line

Thinking that accumulates.

This is not instructional.
Not motivational.
Not coaching.

It is a statement of product physics.

It implies:
- Thinking happens elsewhere.
- It doesn’t disappear.
- It builds.
- Structure exists.
- Motion emerges over time.

---

## Core Product Identity

Thinking → Structure → Motion

AI accelerates thinking.  
INDEX structures thinking.  
Structured thinking enables sustained motion.

INDEX is not:
- A planning tool.
- A journaling app.
- A coaching product.
- A productivity optimizer.

INDEX is:
A structural ledger that stabilizes accelerated thinking.

---

## Emotional Outcome

Not relief.  
Not inspiration.  

The outcome is:

Stability beneath acceleration.

Which produces:
- Lightness.
- Sustained motion.
- Less cognitive drag.
- Less backtracking.
- Less re-deriving context.

Over time, users should feel:

“My thinking doesn’t weigh on me.”

## Direction + Shifts

We demote conceptual vocabulary.

UI terms:
- Direction
- Shifts

We do not expose:
- Arcs
- Phases
- Pulses
- Version history

### Direction

- Emergent.
- Derived from decisions.
- Not editable.
- Grounded in ledger.

Under Direction, include subtle transparency:

> Based on X decisions across Y projects.

Direction is not written.
It forms from accumulated decisions.

Users edit decisions.
Direction recalculates.

---

### Shifts

- Threshold crossings.
- Meaningful structural change.
- Implicit versioning (no visible draft stack).
- No historical comparison UI.

Shifts mark motion.
They do not introduce editing.

---

## Ingestion Philosophy (Summary)

Primary ingestion will become:

Quick Capture (extension)

Manual full-chat paste remains:
- Onboarding-friendly
- Valid for low-frequency users

Bulk JSON import is removed.
Automated GPT account sync is not pursued.

Extension accelerates value.
It does not create value.

Low density still works.
High density increases resolution.

---

## Messaging Constraints

Avoid:
- Coaching tone
- Motivational language
- Self-improvement framing
- “Move lighter”
- “Think freely”
- Growth rhetoric

Language must be:
- Plain
- Calm
- Declarative
- Structural

INDEX states what exists.
It does not instruct.

---

## Canonical Summary

INDEX is not about better memory.

It is about:

Thinking that accumulates.

AI increases thinking velocity.
INDEX increases structural stability.

Stability enables sustained motion.
