# INDEX v2 — System Logic

INDEX is a personal structural nervous system.

It exists after thinking, not during thinking.

Users work and think in external tools:
GPT, conversations, documents, and real-world action.

INDEX receives meaningful thinking and stabilizes its structure.

---

## Design Intent

INDEX does not:
- coach
- interpret meaning
- suggest direction

It exposes structure so direction can emerge naturally.

---

## Structural Model

Projects:
Flat ingestion anchors.
No hierarchy.
No grouping.

Arcs and Phases:
Temporal structures inferred across projects.

Decisions and Results:
Moments where thought becomes action and feedback.

Tension:
Structural friction surfaced only after threshold.

---

## Editorial Surface

INDEX presents a quiet structural briefing.

Pulses signal threshold events.
Field notes provide contextual observation.
Snapshots reflect current structural reality.

Snapshots evolve only when underlying state changes.

---

## Emotional Tone

Thoughtful field note.
Dry without sterility.
Neutral without coldness.

INDEX is a mirror, not a guide.
