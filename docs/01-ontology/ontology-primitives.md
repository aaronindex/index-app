# Ontology Primitives

## Non-Primitives

Field Notes are ingestion events.
They are not ontology primitives.

Field Notes may produce Decisions or Tasks
but never exist as persistent entities.

---

## Temporal Placement

Artifacts carry thinking-time windows.

Arc and phase inference operate on thinking time,
not ingestion time.

Loose temporal ranges are allowed.
Temporal precision is not required for structural inference.

---

## Projects
Flat containers for meaningful thinking imports.
Neutral weight.

Projects are never grouped.
Projects are never nested.

---

## Decisions
Moments where thinking collapses into action.

Carry structural weight.

---

## Results
Feedback loops attached to decisions.
Inform arc evolution.

---

## Arcs
Temporal patterns inferred across projects.
Define relationship through time.

Arcs may activate, compress, or fade via recency.

---

## Phases
Segments within arcs.
Inferred from structural behavior.

---

## Tension
Structural friction between arcs or phases.

Surfaced only after threshold crossing.

Never predictive.
