# INDEX — 30 / 60 / 90 Day Execution Plan (Post-Build v1)

## Purpose
Move INDEX from “built + instrumented” to **real users, real signal, and disciplined traction** — without premature spend, scope creep, or growth theater.

This is an execution document.  
Product foundations are assumed to be in place.

---

## Operating Assumptions (Locked)

- Core product, onboarding, and analytics are **good enough for v0**
- GA4 activation and monetization funnels are live
- The goal is **learning + signal**, not optics
- Manual distribution precedes scale
- No paid ads until activation signal is proven

If any assumption becomes false, pause execution.

---

# DAYS 1–30 — CONTROLLED DISTRIBUTION

## Primary Objective
Validate that **new users can reach first value without founder intervention**.

This phase is about *observing reality*, not redesigning the product.

---

## Definition: First Value

A user reaches *first value* when they independently surface at least one meaningful output:
- a decision
- a task
- or a highlight

This must occur **without coaching**.

---

## WEEK 1 — Distribution Readiness

### Focus
Ensure INDEX can be put in front of real users *without explanation*.

### Actions
- Verify onboarding tour behavior on first login
- Confirm empty states and post-import messaging align with:
  - reduction → focus → carry forward
- Verify reliable firing of activation events:
  - `import_completed`
  - `insights_extracted`
  - `task_created`
  - `ask_index_answered` (has_answer = true)
- Confirm that a user can plausibly reach first value in one session

### Gate
- You can watch a new user reach first value **without explaining anything**

---

## WEEK 2 — First External Users (10–20)

### Focus
Introduce INDEX to a small, high-signal cohort and observe behavior.

### Actions
- Invite 10–20 trusted users (founders, operators, AI-heavy thinkers)
- Maintain a **no-coaching default**
- Capture only:
  - where users stall
  - where value clicks
  - where language confuses

### Gate
- ≥40–50% of users reach first value
- ≥3 users independently describe the *same core benefit*

If unmet, adjust onboarding and copy only — no new features.

---

## WEEK 3 — Expanded Observation (25–50)

### Focus
Test whether activation holds when trust is lower.

### Actions
- Expand access beyond the inner circle
- Continue no-coaching policy
- Segment users by:
  - did not reach value
  - reached value once
  - returned for a second session

### Gate
- Users can explain why INDEX is different **without borrowing your language**

---

## WEEK 4 — Activation Clarity

### Focus
Decide whether activation is strong enough to proceed.

### Actions
- Review activation funnel end-to-end
- Identify the **single largest drop-off**
- Decide:
  - proceed to traction
  - or pause and tighten onboarding

### Gate
- Clear activation narrative
- One dominant friction point identified

---

# DAYS 31–60 — REPEATABLE ACTIVATION

## Primary Objective
Prove you can **consistently** bring new users to first value.

---

## Weekly Operating Loop (Weeks 5–8)

Each week:
- Publish **one real artifact** showing INDEX in use
- Personally invite new users (manual distribution)
- Run **one small-group exposure** (Slack, intro call, demo)
- Fix **one** onboarding or clarity issue max

---

## Weekly Gates
- 10–20 new users per week
- ≥40% reach first value
- ≥20% return for a second session

If activation drops, pause distribution.

---

# DAYS 61–90 — MONETIZATION SIGNAL

## Primary Objective
Determine whether users will **pay for continuity**.

This phase tests willingness, not revenue scale.

---

## Actions
- Introduce a light paid boundary (continuity-based, not feature-based)
- Observe:
  - upgrade views
  - checkout starts
  - completed subscriptions
- Measure time from first value → upgrade attempt

---

## Gate
- ≥2–5% of activated users attempt upgrade
- Clear language emerges for *why* they upgrade

If zero attempts occur, the issue is value clarity — not pricing.

---

# Explicitly Not Yet

Do **not** advance to:
- Paid ads
- Aggressive SEO
- Fundraising

Until:
- Activation is repeatable
- Monetization signal exists
- Growth mechanics can be explained in one paragraph
