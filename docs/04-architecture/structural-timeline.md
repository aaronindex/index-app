# Structural Timeline

The Structural Timeline exposes spacing of structural change across event time.

It is not a feature layer.
It is a projection of persistent structural events onto a temporal surface.

The timeline introduces no narrative, analysis, or semantic interpretation.

---

## Purpose

Reveal motion through spacing alone.

Users perceive:

- acceleration
- pause
- drift

without INDEX naming or explaining those states.

The timeline exists to make temporal physics perceptible,
not to interpret behavior.

---

## Deep Principle

INDEX records structural change, not cognitive activity.

The timeline expresses:

spacing_of_structural_change = distance between structural events in event time.

---

## Data Source

Only persistent structural artifacts appear:

- Decisions
- Results

Excluded:

- Chats
- Imports
- Field Notes
- Pulses
- Snapshots
- AI outputs
- Editorial artifacts

If an artifact does not influence structure,
it does not appear on the timeline.

---

## Temporal Positioning

Timeline position derives exclusively from thinking time.


position_on_line = midpoint(thinking_window)


`ingested_at` is ignored for spatial placement.

Ingestion time is operational metadata only.

---

## Visual Language

The timeline is silent and minimal.

- One horizontal line
- Uniform marks
- No labels
- No legend
- No colors
- No icons
- No categories
- No grouping
- No animation
- No density shading

Example:


────────────•────•──────────•───•────────────


---

## Interaction Model (v1)

Interaction is informational only.

Hover reveals:


Decision — <date>


or


Result — <date>


No additional metadata is shown.

No navigation or expansion behavior is required.

---

## Non-Goals

The timeline is NOT:

- an activity feed
- a progress tracker
- a productivity surface
- an analytics view
- a trajectory visualization
- a roadmap

INDEX does not label motion.

Users infer motion through spacing.

---

## Placement

The Structural Timeline appears within Snapshot view
as a silent preface to editorial language.

It does not exist as a standalone page.

---

## Cross-Scale Consistency

The form of the timeline remains constant across:

- Individual context
- Organizational context
- World AI reference layer

Only the field of authorship expands.

---

## Drift Guardrails

Future expansions must not introduce:

- narrative overlays
- semantic clustering
- color coding
- icons
- trajectory lines
- motion labels (e.g. "Acceleration detected")
- ingestion-time positioning

If interpretation becomes necessary,
it belongs in editorial text — not on the timeline.

---

## Structural Definition

The timeline is the temporal cross-section of the structural ledger.

It exposes when structure changed,
not why it changed.
