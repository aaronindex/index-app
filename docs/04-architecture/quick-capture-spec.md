# Capture Specification — INDEX v2

## Purpose

Define the unified ingestion gesture for INDEX.

Capture enables structural elevation
without turning INDEX into a thinking surface.

---

## Capture Flow

1. User captures content.
2. User selects container:
   - Me (Self)
   - Project
3. Optional: Reduce & Discard Source
4. Structural inference runs.
5. Structural state updates.

---

## Source Modes

### Durable (Default)

- Source remains internally.
- May accumulate structural weight.
- May influence Directions.
- May contribute to Shifts.

### Reduce & Discard Source

- Source interpreted once.
- Source removed after interpretation.
- Only resulting structural outputs persist.
- Does not accumulate pattern weight.

---

## Structural Output

Externally visible structural state includes:

- Directions
- Shifts

Internal mechanisms:

- Arc detection
- Phase inference
- Pulse emission
- Tension scoring
- state_hash computation

These remain internal and non-exported.

## Guardrails

Capture must never:

- Become a journaling interface
- Store ambient data
- Expose editorial language externally
- Create conversational state

INDEX remains a structural ledger.
