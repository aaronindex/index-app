INDEX — One-Pager North Star
Personal Business Intelligence for your AI life.
What Index Is

Index is your Personal BI layer — a private memory system that turns your AI conversations into actionable intelligence.
You think in GPT, Claude, Cursor, Slack.
Index captures the meaning of all that thinking — and makes it usable.

Index is not a chat interface.
It is the sensemaking system for your AI-powered life.

The Problem

People generate more ideas, insights, and problem-solving in AI chats than anywhere else — but:

Everything is ephemeral

Nothing is organized

Context disappears

Decisions vanish

Themes get lost

There is no “memory” of who you are across conversations

AI amplifies thinking…
but destroys continuity.

Index restores it.

The Solution

Index imports your AI conversations and transforms them into a structured, searchable, evolving memory graph:

Projects → containers for related work

Chats → imported conversations

Branches → sub-threads created from highlights

Highlights → atomic units of meaning

Status → Priority, Open, Complete, Dormant

Decisions → permanent record of commitments

Weekly Digest → narrative intelligence summary

Toolbelt → Summary, Review, Decisions, Digest

You never lose a thought.
You always know what’s important.
You always understand what changed.
